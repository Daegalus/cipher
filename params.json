Most of the classes are ports of Bouncy Castle from Java to Dart. The\r\nporting is almost always direct except for some classes that had been added to\r\nease the use of low level data.\r\n\r\nTests and benchmarks for every algorithm are also provided. The expected results\r\nfor the tests are computed with the Bouncy Castle Java version and matched\r\nagainst the results got from Dart.\r\n\r\nCurrently the following algorithms are implemented:\r\n\r\n* AES (block cipher)\r\n* SIC (mode of operation)\r\n* Salsa20 (stream cipher)\r\n\r\nSee file HISTORY.md for detailed information on the history of the project.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
